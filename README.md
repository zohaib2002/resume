# Résumé 

### About
It is my simple resume made with HTML, CSS, JS using JSON data.

HTML is used for making the initial block structure of the page with some simple data, CSS is used for giving some style to the page, and JS is used to create small UI components dynamically and fill the data into the page. All the data about details related to the user is stored as a JSON object in a JS file.
